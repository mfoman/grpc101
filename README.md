# Assignment 2

1. What are packages in your implementation? What data structure do you use to transmit data and meta-data?

The packet (assuming that is what the question is referring to) we have used, is a simulation of a tcp header as seen in *tcp/tcp.proto*. The packet is transmitted with the protobuffer protocol from the gRPC pacakge.

2. Does your implementation use threads or processes? Why is it not realistic to use threads?

Our implementation use processes in which we communicate with gRPC (protobuffer). Threads are not realistic, because they don't use the underlying network devices to communicate.

3. How do you handle message re-ordering?

We could handle message re-ordering using a sequence number for each message sent, so the messages can be reordered on the receiving end.

4. How do you handle message loss?

We could handle message loss, by using timeouts for awaiting the acknowledgements, so if an acknowledgement isn't received within a time frame, a new request is sent.

5. Why is the 3-way handshake important?

To ensure a reliable connection and guarantee the data is sent correctly.

## Setup of repository

1. make ``go.mod`` file with:

    ``$ go mod init [link to repo without "https://"]``

    your repo should be on the public github. i couldn't get it to work on the itu instance.
    > **Tip!**
    > 
    > You can use ``example.com``, if you don't have a repo.
2. make a ``.proto`` file in a sub-directory, for example ``time/time.proto`` and fill it with IDL.
    - notice line 3 and 4.

        ```Go
        package time;
        option go_package = "https://github.itu.dk/nako/DISYS-week5;time";
        ```

        the ``go_package`` should equal a link to your repo, a semicolon and then the package name.
        > **Tip!**
        > 
        > Notice the semicolon and the package-name at the end of the link. If you used example.com, you should write ``... = "https://example.com/;packagename";``.
3. run command:

    ``$ protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative time/time.proto``

    which should create the two ``pb.go`` files. Remember to change "time" to your directory and file name.
4. run command:

    ``$ go mod tidy``

    to install dependencies and create the ``go.sum`` file.
5. create a ``client\client.go`` file with the ``client_template.txt`` as template.
    > **Tip!**
    >
    > When implementing your grpc methods, you should write the link without "https://" and with the packagename at the end. If you used example.com, you should write ``"example.com/package"``. If you used a long name for your package, you can write a shorter name before the quotation marks, for example ``pckg "example.com/longpackagename"``.
6. create a ``server\server.go`` file with the ``server_template.txt`` as template.
7. switch out the "myPackage" with your actual package.
8. switch our the method names with actual method names.
9. add more methods to the ``client.go`` file, so that there's a method for each request in the ``.proto`` file.
10. when everything is compilable, open a terminal, change directory to the ``server`` folder, and run the command:

    ``$ go run .``

    this will start your server.
11. open a new terminal, change directory to the ``client`` folder and run the command:

    ``$ go run .``

    this will run the requests listed in the ``main`` method of the ``client`` file.
12. create a ``Dockerfile`` like the one in this repository.
13. change line 11, 12 and 16 to match your repository.
    > **from now on**
    >
    > please remember to commit and push changes to the files in your repository before running the program.
    >
    > the following docker commands will clone your repository (maybe to the virtual machine?), so changes to files will not be applied, if you don't git commit yeet before.
    >
    > the only exception (i think) is changes to the ``client.go`` file, since it's run locally on your computer, but just connects to the server in docker.
14. run command:

    ``$ docker build -t test --no-cache .``

    to build the code. what you write after ``-t`` will be the name of your image, so the name of the image here is ``test``. the name doesn't matter, but it helps you identify it in the docker desktop app.
15. run command:

    ``$ docker run -p 9080:9080 -tid test``

    to run the code in a docker container. if you changed the name of the image from ``test``, make sure to change it in this command as well.
16. change directory into your ``client`` folder.
17. run command:

    ``$ go run .``

    to run the code.

## Prerequisites

1. before starting, install google's protocol buffers:
    - go to this link: <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads>
    - click on the "release page" link.
    - find the version you need and download it.
    - as per october 2021, if your on windows, it's the third from the bottom, ``protoc-3.18.1-win64.zip``.
2. unzip the downloaded file somewhere "safe".
    - on my windows machine, i placed it in ``C:\Program Files\Protoc``
3. add the path to the ``bin`` folder to your system variables.
    - on windows, click the windows key and search for "system", then there should come something up like "edit the system environment variables".
    - click the button "environment variables..." at the bottom.
    - in the bottom list select the variable called "path" and click "edit ..."
    - in the pop-up window, click "new..."
    - paste the total path to the ``bin`` folder into the text field.

        my path is ``C:\Program Files\Protoc\bin``.
    - click "ok".
4. open a terminal and run these commands:

    ``$ go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.26``

    ``$ go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.1``
